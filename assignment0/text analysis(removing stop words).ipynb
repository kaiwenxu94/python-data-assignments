       "'“Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war\\n\\nThe Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9, 2018\\n\\nChina’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.\\n\\nSince the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year, both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports, while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going, its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people, according to state media.\\n\\n“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood, which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public,\\'” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate,’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country,’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\\n\\nThat comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year, it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online, people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far, and worrying about what’s to come.\\n\\nStocks tumble, yuan devalues\\nOn Monday (Oct.7), the first day after the Golden Week holiday, Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general, China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.\\n\\n“This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts,” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo, who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home, the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer, sadly, was this—deleveraging, bad stock performance, and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”\\n\\nREUTERS/MARIANA BAZO\\nLooking for new markets.\\nThe devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive, it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency, for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.\\n\\n“We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive,” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).\\n\\nSnacks, oil prices up\\nTreats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs, and so are daily necessities.\\n\\n“I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock,” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province, but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day, including pecans, commonly sourced from the US, cost her more.\\n\\n“I asked the shop owner, ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war,” she continued, “And I asked him, ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”\\n\\nAs for Maine lobster, forget about it.\\n\\nChinese drivers are also feeling the pinch, with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.\\n\\n“I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year, there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown, which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war, and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car,” wrote a user (link in Chinese).\\n\\nSmall businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, a better gauge of sentiment at smaller, private firms than the official manufacturing PMI, declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month, the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.\\n\\nREUTERS\\nIn response to US tariffs, China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.\\nPessimism about the new NAFTA\\nPeople aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact, the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US, Mexico, and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China, some online commenters noted.\\n\\n“Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo, based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure, foreign trade, and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs. \\n\\n“In terms of foreign trade, this is the most worrying,” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September, the US, Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market, it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”\\n\\n(The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy, and also give one another a say in the deal.)\\n\\n“Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round, the Mexico gave in, then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan, then Europe,” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister\\n\\nSCMP Amanda Lee\\n\\nChina will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports, China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said, signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.\\n\\n“There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs, China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China,” Zhong said, in a statement published by Bloomberg News.\\n\\n“This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history, but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war, but would rise up to it should it break out.\\n\\n“The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”\\n\\n\\nThis is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war, in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.\\n\\nThe strong comments from Zhong, whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US, coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.\\n\\nCompanies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN\\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday, had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\\n\\nWang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China, while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.\\n\\nProspects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.\\n\\nThe two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.\\n\\n\\nThe US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports, and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products, with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.\\n\\nChina’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies\\nUS President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.\\n\\nChina retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.\\n\\nChina’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP\\nWashington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.\\n\\nZhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.\\n\\n“I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour,” he said.\\n\\n“China’s economic development, and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”\\n\\nAs US turns up heat on China, trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts\\nZhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.\\n\\n“If one side had been taken advantage of all the time, could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of,” Zhong said.\\n\\nThe conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade, with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.\\n\\nPence also warned American companies, including tech giant Alphabet, which owns Google, to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China\\n\\nDonna Borak, CNN\\n\\nUpdated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9, 2018\\n\\nBali, Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.\\n\\nAfter announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week, Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea, Japan, the European Union.\\nHe scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs, suggesting that \"we wouldn\\'t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.\\nThe trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year, the IMF warns\\n\"That\\'s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China,\" said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\nTrump\\'s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali, Indonesia. And it\\'ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the president\\'s top economic envoy, to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\\n\"The stakes are high,\" Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"\\n\\'Coalition of the willing\\'\\nIf the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea, Canada and Mexico, that\\'s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing, top administration officials argue.\\nUS and Canada reach deal on NAFTA\\n\\nUS and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58\\n\"We are talking to the European Union again, we are talking to Japan again, and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China,\" Larry Kudlow, Trump\\'s chief economic adviser, said last week.\\nBut talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn\\'t sign trade deals with any country that doesn\\'t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change, a clear reference to the United States.\\nThe Trump administration\\'s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\\nOther big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China, including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China, which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.\\nThe Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.\\nSouring relationship\\nTrump has made clear he\\'s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead, he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\\n\"I\\'m using them to negotiate,\" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully, we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"\\nTrade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs\\nTrade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs\\nDetails of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico, which is set to replace NAFTA, show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.\\nTucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy,\" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.\\nThat move has upset Beijing, further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.\\nIn a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions,\" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"\\n\\'How much pain are they willing to endure?\\'\\nNeither side is showing signs of backing down.\\nThe United States, whose economy relies less on exports than China\\'s, is faring better so far. China\\'s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\\nChina is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up\\n\"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes, a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"\\nFor its part, the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.\\n\"We have changed the paradigm,\" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place, and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"\\nTrump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.\\nBut with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy, the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.\\n\"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided,\" Andrew Hunter, US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?\\nThe debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.\\n\\nOCT 9, 2018\\n\\nLate last week, as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle, Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China, and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part, it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific, its trade abuses, its hostility to religious freedom, and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks, the vice president shifted his emphasis, turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.\\n\\nSpecifically, Pence warned that “China wants a different American president,” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now, it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies, and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce, regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence, however, there is another layer to the politics of trade, namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages, as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections, and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.\\n\\nMORE BY REIHAN SALAM\\n Students walk by the law school at the University of Michigan\\nElite Law Schools Turn Against Conservatism\\nREIHAN SALAM\\n Donald Trump\\nHow Trump Can Strike Back at the Deep State\\nREIHAN SALAM\\n \\nA Better Way to Absorb Refugees\\nREIHAN SALAM\\n Senator Elizabeth Warren speaks at an event to introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2017.\\n‘Medicare for All’ Is a Fantasy\\nREIHAN SALAM\\nAll of this was in keeping with President Donald Trump’s blunt insistence that “we’ve found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration,” and, more pointedly, that “they do not want me—or us—to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.”\\n\\nThe implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this: Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea, warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach, which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive,” there is no question that, as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed, “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries, including the United States.”\\n\\nNeedless to say, one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals, and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity, when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion, it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or, as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it, the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.\\n\\nIn 1997, not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic, he observed, it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy, Americans told themselves, we enjoyed freedom and equality. So, too, in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry, and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society,” wrote Huntington, “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”\\n\\nWhat Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right, one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles, many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction, and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership, our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.\\n\\nAnd so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals, it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state, they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests, and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations, despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.\\n\\nIt is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe, in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested, the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics, for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.\\n\\nThe Putin ascendancy has been defined by, in the first place, rank kleptocracy, but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism, in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued, Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion, Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism, and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short, Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy, just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.\\n\\nAn America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism, including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral, nondiscriminatory basis, while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up, which is all to the good, but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe, a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.\\n\\nAnd as for the Chinese party-state, it wouldn’t exactly be a friend, especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties, but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order, the Paris agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles, especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time, a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power, especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities, as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible, and Beijing would have the upper hand.\\n\\nWhat would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other,” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense, which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base, and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s, market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism, and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire, with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing, not Moscow, is public enemy No. 1, it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital, and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas, not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival, I suspect, but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China, as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.\\n\\nCulturally, choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants, visitors, and students, which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument, in essence, would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state, not China as a whole, and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed, Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly, an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism, not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.\\n\\nWhich enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide, the stakes are high, and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence, Threaten ‘Cold War’\\n\\n8 Oct 2018\\n\\nChina’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”\\nThe Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday, beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.\\n\\nThe editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China, such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China, and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.\\n\\nThe Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft, democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:\\n\\nThe US, in fact, has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.\\n\\nIt’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites, the so-called Cold War will not take shape.\\n\\nAt such a time, China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.\\n\\nChina is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.\\n\\nThat last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.\\n\\nOn Monday, the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute, filled with accusations that were “vitriolic, ruthless, and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”\\n\\nThis second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap,” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers, usually to the regret of both nations, unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.\\n\\nBeijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.\\n\\nAs far as the Chinese are concerned, they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon, and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.\\n\\nThe Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September, widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.\\n\\n“Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein, the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war,” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.\\n\\nThe Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:\\n\\nThe reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.\\n\\nTrump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.\\n\\nThese unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional, shallow and indiscreet, which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.\\n\\nWhen the leader of a state accuses other countries at will, how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.\\n\\nThe Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election.'"

public support it would like since the us and china entered a trade war in earnest this year both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods the us has put new tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports while china has done the same to 110 billion worth of us goods and while china s running out of us goods to keep the retaliation going its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the us is the spirit of the chinese people according to state media  the heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself  has always run through chinese blood which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one s interest for the greater good of the public   said an opinion piece link in chinese posted by the state-run people s daily on july 10  facing this  war of national fate   chinese are deeply aware that  there s no home without a country   so they are willing to bear temporary losses   that comment doesn t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people economists estimate that if the latest chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25 next year it could shave half a percentage point off china

wrote  the americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the wto [world trade organization] and build something new at the end of september the us canada and mexico signed a new cooperation agreement the agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market it needs the approval of all the three countries  everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy  is   the new nafta asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy and also give one another a say in the deal  americans have been building an anti-china circle in the first round the mexico gave in then canada i am afraid that the third round is japan then europe   said another link in chinese  i highly suggest that china should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites  china won t back down in trade war with us  commerce minister scmp amanda lee china will not cave in to us demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports china s commerce minister zhong shan has said signalling beijing s uncompromising stance in dealing with us  there is a view in the us that so long as the us keeps increasing tariffs china will back down they don t know the history and culture of china   zhong said in a statement published by bloomberg news  this unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions china doesn t want a trade war but would rise up to it should it break out  the us should not underestimate china s resolve and will   this is beijing s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war in which china blamed the us for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade the strong comments from zhong whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the us coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between beijing and washington companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofchina s commerce minister zhong shan us secretary of state mike pompeo on a brief visit to beijing on monday had a testy exchange with chinese foreign minister wang yi wang told pompeo the us had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against china while pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers prospects for beijing and washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright the two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises the us initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on us 50 billion worth of chinese imports and in september added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional us 200 billion of chinese products with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on january 1 if china does not make trade concessions china s central bank to pump us 110 billion into economy as us trade war intensifies us president donald trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all chinese imports china retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on us 50 billion of us imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further us 60 billion of us imports china s foreign minister wang yi left and us secretary of state mike pompeo had a testy exchange on monday in beijing photo  ap washington is demanding china change its trade practices of forcing us businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises zhong reiterated beijing s line that china does not steal technology from us firms  i want to emphasise that china s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies  purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said  china s economic development and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the chinese people   as us turns up heat on china trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts zhong also argued that china never  took advantage of the us  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of us 31 05 billion with the us in august  if one side had been taken advantage of all the time could such business relations have continued  companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   zhong said the conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade with trump s accusations that china is attempting to interfere in the 2018 us midterm congressional elections vice-president mike pence also stepped up the attack by condemning beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the us political system pence also warned american companies including tech giant alphabet which owns google to disengage from china trump rips up the trade playbook to take on china donna borak cnn updated 1037 gmt 1837 hkt october 9 2018 bali indonesia cnn president donald trump wants a deal with china   just not anytime soon after announcing a revamped trade agreement with canada and mexico last week trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to us demands to hold talks or make a deal  south korea japan the european union he scoffed at those babies out there who worried about the effects of tariffs suggesting that we wouldn t be talking about a deal with canada and mexico without his confrontational approach the trade war will hit us and chinese growth next year the imf warns that s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of china said edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations trump s no-holds-barred strategy on china is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in bali indonesia and it ll be up to treasury secretary steven mnuchin the president s top economic envoy to argue the us case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth the stakes are high christine lagarde the managing director of the international monetary fund said last week we need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes coalition of the willing if the trump administration can get the european union and japan on side following the recent trade deals with south korea canada and mexico that s likely to strengthen the us negotiating position with beijing top administration officials argue us and canada reach deal on nafta us and canada reach deal on nafta 01 58 we are talking to the european union again we are talking to japan again and we are moving to what i have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront china larry kudlow trump s chief economic adviser said last week but talks with europe and japan are still in the early stages and french president emmanuel macron said last month that europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the paris agreement on climate change a clear reference to the united states the trump administration s approach to building a coalition against beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns other big economies like the european union and japan share some of the main us grievances with china including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to chinese partners but trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against china which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front the trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of china 39;s annual goods exports to the united states souring relationship trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with beijing anytime soon instead he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another 267 billion of chinese products that would mean the us measures effectively cover all the goods china sells to the united states each year i m using them to negotiate trump said of the tariffs and hopefully we can make a great deal with china   a fair deal and a reciprocal deal trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs details of the revised pact with canada and mexico which is set to replace nafta show that the us government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on china tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a non-market economy a clear reference to china the other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with china that move has upset beijing further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers in a frank exchange of views in beijing on monday chinese foreign minister wang yi told us secretary of state mike pompeo that the united states should immediately stop its wrong remarks and actions including the trade war pompeo responded that the two countries have a fundamental disagreement and that the united states has great concerns about actions that china has taken how much pain are they willing to endure  neither side is showing signs of backing down the united states whose economy relies less on exports than china s is faring better so far china s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated china is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up the question is  how much pain are they willing to endure  said thomas bernes a distinguished fellow for the centre for international governance innovation they will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power for its part the trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can we have changed the paradigm us trade representative robert lighthizer said last month we have tariffs in place and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property trump is expected to meet with chinese president xi jinping at the group of 20 leaders summit in buenos aires at the end of november but with beijing unwilling to give ground on us demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim it is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with china will be avoided andrew hunter us economist at research firm capital economics said in a note to clients last week is china or russia america s defining rival  the debate doesn t just have consequences for u s foreign policy it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well oct 9 2018 late last week as most of america s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the kavanaugh confirmation battle vice president mike pence gave a wide-ranging address on the u s relationship with china and why the trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs for the most part it was a familiar litany of complaints about china s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western pacific its trade abuses its hostility to religious freedom and its support of unsavory regimes around the world yet halfway through his remarks the vice president shifted his emphasis turning from all the various ways the chinese party-state was acting in the world outside america s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them specifically pence warned that  china wants a different american president   and that beijing was mobilizing  covert actors front groups and propaganda outlets to shift americans  perception of chinese policies  to that end by now it has become routine for the heads of u s multinationals to condemn the trump administration s trade policies and the fact that they d do so is perfectly understandable china s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce regardless of their citizenship according to pence however there is another layer to the politics of trade namely that senior chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce u s tariffs he pointed to the rising sophistication with which beijing exploits america s domestic political cleavages as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of chinese policies on university campuses desperate for chinese money more by reihan salam students walk by the law school at the university of michigan elite law schools turn against conservatism

in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in november against my administration   and more pointedly that  they do not want me or us to win because i am the first president ever to challenge china on trade   the implicit question raised by both pence and trump is this  should we be more worried about chinese meddling than russian meddling  some observers have dismissed the idea warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing russian meddling others acknowledge that while china s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from russia s approach which beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that as rush doshi and robert d williams of the brookings institution have cautiously observed  china has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries including the united states   needless to say one could see both russia and china as dangerous rivals and i certainly do but in an age of intensifying partisan enmity when large numbers of americans question the legitimacy of the trump presidency while similarly large numbers see donald trump as their champion it is fitting that democrats and republicans can t bring themselves to agree on which of the world s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or as the harvard political scientist samuel p huntington once put it the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape in 1997 not long after the collapse of the soviet bloc huntington warned that american grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because america s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other   in the early days of the republic he observed it was britain that offered this necessary contrast  while the british lived under tyranny and hierarchy americans told themselves we enjoyed freedom and equality so too in later years did wilhelmine germany provide an orienting rivalry and then the nazi and soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century the soviet union s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis  while wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote huntington  a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people the weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse   what huntington did not quite anticipate is that america would find itself divided between two creedal identities one right one left each of which defines itself against a different enemy this is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether revolutionary france or the british empire represented the greater threat to american liberty the early 1900s saw debates between germanophiles many of whom were progressives and socialists of german extraction and anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a british-american condominium the difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of american global leadership our creedal clashes reverberate around the world and so the united states finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars to cosmopolitan liberals it is russia that serves as america s chief geopolitical adversary even in russia s weakened and impoverished state they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within nationalist conservatives see rising chinese power as the far graver threat to american interests and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter beijing s depredations despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result it is not difficult to understand why russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination there is at this point little doubt that the russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the u s and democratic europe in part out of a conviction that western liberals have done much the same throughout post-soviet eurasia though the extent to which russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 u s presidential election is contested the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among trump s liberal critics for whom vladimir putin is the perfect foil the putin ascendancy has been defined by in the first place rank kleptocracy but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism in which the chief enemies of the russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism as the american author timothy snyder has argued putinism s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy   while defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family in short putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see russia under his rule as their enemy just as he invites right-wing populists in the western democracies to see him as a friend an america that defines itself against putin s russia is an america that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral nondiscriminatory basis while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde nato would be shored up which is all to the good but the u s would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in central and eastern europe a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the american orbit and as for the chinese party-state it wouldn t exactly be a friend especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties but the chinese communist party s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy shortly after trump s inauguration xi jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order the paris agreement and the joint comprehensive plan of action with iran and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of uighur muslims for political crimes over time a u s grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of chinese power especially if the chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities as seems likely but by then the economic integration of the western democracies with china might be irreversible and beijing would have the upper hand what would it mean for the u s to instead choose china as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it  one early indication comes from a recent report from the department of defense which details america s growing dependence on china s manufacturing base and the threat this poses to the country s war-fighting capabilities in the 1990s and 2000s market conservatives could point to the soviet collapse as an indictment of statism and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions if beijing not moscow is public enemy no 1 it is vital that the u s boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital and that it steer u s firms to build resilient supply chains based in the americas not in china s industrial heartland russia would still be a rival i suspect but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with china as would become much clearer once putin himself exits the scene culturally choosing china as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects one can imagine a xenophobic turn against chinese immigrants visitors and students which would have ugly consequences yet one can also imagine an embrace of the chinese people on the grounds that beijing s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers the argument in essence would be that the u s stands against the party-state not china as a whole and that america would welcome a more just and inclusive chinese government indeed pence made exactly this argument in his recent address more broadly an america waging a cold war on china might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism not least because disentangling the american and chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the u s business elite a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms which enemy will we choose in the years to come  which cold war will we wage most assiduously  the answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come if history is any guide the stakes are high and the consequences will be enduring chinese media vow to fight against  insult  from pence threaten  cold war  8 oct 2018 china s state-run global times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from u s vice president mike pence and promised a  new cold war  if the trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches   the global times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on sunday beginning with strong criticism of pence s speech at the hudson institute last thursday and citing observers who compared it to sir winston churchill s  iron curtain  speech about the soviet union at the dawn of the cold war the editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between america and china such as u s president richard nixon s opening to china and even took some credit for helping president ronald reagan put the soviet union out of business the global times then reiterated beijing s standard line about how soft democratic america stands no chance against authoritarian china in a trade war and positioned beijing as the more mature player in a conflict washington has not yet realized it cannot win  the us in fact has limited leverage to contain china a trade war will inevitably damage the us and is a stupid choice it s unrealistic to establish a nato-style organization to target china it is impossible to isolate and contain china given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets it s difficult for the white house and congress to mobilize an anti-china campaign in us society gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest as long as china keeps calm in the face of hysterical us political elites the so-called cold war will not take shape at such a time china should play tai chi with the us this is the unique strategic wisdom of the chinese nation we must make the us feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the us to act unscrupulously in the south china sea and taiwan straits but we must act in a calm way china will continue to open up a deteriorating outside world will not change that china is not the soviet union the us cannot deal with china as it did with the soviet union that last line became a chinese political mantra with blinding speed after pence s speech to the hudson institute was compared to churchill s iron curtain speech on monday the global times pronounced china hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech pence delivered to the hudson institute filled with accusations that were  vitriolic ruthless and delivered in terms considered far from decorous   this second editorial invoked the  thucydides trap   which has become another common talking point for chinese politicians the thucydides trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers usually to the regret of both nations unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict beijing s interpretation of thucydides is that america has a unique responsibility to welcome china as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting american dominance by attempting to  contain  china as far as the chinese are concerned they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon and they cannot understand why the trump administration suddenly decided to make a  u-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain china the global times defended the ad china took out in the des moines register in september widely seen as a major reason for the trump administration s complaint about chinese interference in u s elections  where is the u s   long-hailed freedom of the press  a state-run newspaper from one of the world s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked in a similar vein the global times portrayed china as merely seeking to defend itself from a  u s -initiated trade war   as if china has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades the global times concluded president trump is beating up on china to goose republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the russiagate scandal  the reason that the trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when china-us trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming us midterm elections trump knows that playing the china card is always the safest option it cannot only divert domestic attention from the russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters these unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the trump administration on sino-us relations are unprofessional shallow and indiscreet which is most worrying the worsening atmosphere toward china in the us not only affects american public  opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of chinese in the us when the leader of a state accuses other countries at will how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties  perhaps the trump government needs to think about how to show respect to china before requesting china to respect the us the chinese appear to know the american left is very receptive to theories that president trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  russian collusion  in the 2016 election '"
